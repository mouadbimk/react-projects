# 🧠 React Practice Projects

This repository contains a collection of small React projects I built to practice and master core React concepts such as **state**, **props**, **lifting state**, **derived state**, **controlled components**, and **form handling**.

Each project focuses on specific ideas and is structured for reusability and clarity.

- 🔹 **Derived State** – computing values based on other state
- 🔹 **Reusable Components** – building flexible UI pieces
- 🔹 **Controlled Components** – form inputs linked with state
- 🔹 **Form Handling** – managing form data and validation
